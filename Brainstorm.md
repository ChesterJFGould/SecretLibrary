# Ideas
+ Have account tied to randomly generated id
	- Acts as a username/password combo
	- Can be just put into a qr code, Secret Library card thing
+ Only accounts which have found a book can add more
	- Helps stop people who aren't actually interested from just creating fake books
+ Only have written directions, shouldn't provide map showing where books are
	- Simpler implementation
	- More fun
+ Leaderboards for created and found books
	- Leaderboards are for private groups
	- Once a book is "checkout out" it belongs to the one who found it and no longer contributes to "created" score
	- Creates a sort of ctf thing
	- How to incentivize not to just keep many books in house for high score?
		+ Only give points when book is found?
+ Friends list
+ Use hash of id as "public key"
